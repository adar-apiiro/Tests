# Square SDK Autoload Example

This Ruby project demonstrates the use of `autoload` to dynamically load the Square Ruby SDK for payment processing.

## Setup

1. Install Bundler if you haven't already:
```bash
gem install bundler
```

2. Install the dependencies by running:
```bash
bundle install
```

## Running the Example

Just run the main script:
```bash
ruby main.rb
```

Make sure to replace placeholder values in `payment_processor.rb` with your actual Square access token and other relevant data.
